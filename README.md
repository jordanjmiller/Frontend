Temporary Documentation:

Login.js:

Enter username and password. onSubmit, axios.get server's /api/auth/login endpoint. If username/password match a user on the server, a token containing the user object is returned and saved into sessionStorage, and then the user is redirected to their dashboard (helper > student). Link to SignUpForm at the bottom of login form.

SignUpForm.js

Form to create a new user. On Submit, new user object is sent to server. If username has not already been taken, it returns a success message (else error) and the form calls the login endpoint using the new user's username and password. Once that succeeds the user is redirected to their dashboard.

SignUpForm Validation:

Username: must start with a letter and may only contain a-z, _, and numbers.

Password: must be between 5 and 20 characters long and include one capitol letter, number, and special character.

Name: Cannot be null

Helper/Student: One or both must be selected

Email/cohort: Optional inputs, not currently validated except email has input type:email.


PrivateRoute:

Allows access or redirects based off currentUser and token status. Routes:

if token exists:

    if path = /StudentDashboard

        if currentUser.student render component

        else return 'Must be student!' and redirect home

    else if path = /HelperDashboard

        if currentUser.helper render component

        else return 'Must be helper!!' and redirect home

    if path = /Login

        return 'Already logged in!' and redirect to LogOff


else (token does not exist): return 'Must be logged in!' alert and redirect to login page.
